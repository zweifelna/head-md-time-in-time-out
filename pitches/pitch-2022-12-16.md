# Inner Beat

Whether intriguing, disturbing or even painful, we encounter sound pollution, as known as sound storms, in our daily routines. To deal with it, you have an "Inner Beat", linked to a little creature, a blob, to help you to focus and be protected.

However, if the danger level of the storm is too high, the blob starts to deteriorate and so does the protection. You can reconstitute it by resynchronizing its rhythm or spontaneously cooperating with others. When walking outside, be careful not to lose your Inner Beat in front of sound aggression to avoid your blob suffering.

Do you prefer to survive on your own, or will you seek allies to support you?
