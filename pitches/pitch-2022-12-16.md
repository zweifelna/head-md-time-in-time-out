# Inner Beat

The Inner Beat is a portable gaming device that is worn on the wrist. It has a screen with a "blob" that reacts to ambient sound through an integrated microphone. The louder the sound, the more the "blob" deteriorates and the more complex the vibrations it sends out become. To rebuild the shape, simply tap in rhythm on the screen in response to wrist vibrations. The more the player follows the rhythm, the faster the shape is rebuilt.

In addition, when another "blob" is nearby, the reconstruction is even faster, adding a social dimension to the game. The Inner Beat also offers a unique poetic and social experience by allowing players to connect and help each other.
