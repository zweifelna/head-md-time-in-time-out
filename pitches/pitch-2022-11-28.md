# Inner Beat

It is a world where people have to live with a lot of noise pollution which is characterised as a sound storm. Everyone has an "Inner Beat", allowing them to create a beat that protects them from the usual noise pollution. 
However, if the danger level of the storm is too high, people have to synchronise their Inner Beat to create a better protection. This often results in large gatherings in places like stadiums. 
In cases where people do not protect themselves well enough, they can end up in hospital or die in the worst case.
