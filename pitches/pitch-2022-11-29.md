# Inner Beat

It is a world where people have to live with a lot of noise pollution which is characterised as a sound storm (at different levels) . 

Everyone has an "Inner Beat", linked to their heartbeat, allowing them to focus on and protect them from the usual noise pollution.

However, if the danger level of the storm is too high, people can have serious health issue, so they need to cooperate with others to create a better protection.
