# Inner Beat

Whether intriguing, disturbing or even painful, we encounter sound pollution, as known as sound storms, in our daily routines.
To deal with it, everyone has an "Inner Beat", linked to their heartbeat, allowing them to focus on and protect them.

However, if the danger level of the storm is too high, people can have serious health issue, so they can spontaneous cooperate and synchronize with others to create a better protection.
Will you prefer to survive on your own enough, or will you seek allies to support you?
