# Inner Beat

Whether intriguing, disturbing or even painful, we encounter sound pollution, as known as sound storms, in our daily routines. To deal with it, you have an "Inner Beat", linked to your heartbeat, allowing you to focus on and protect you.

However, if the danger level of the storm is too high, you can have serious health issue, so you can spontaneous cooperate and synchronize with others to create a better protection. When walking outside, be careful not to lose your Inner Beat in front of sound aggression to avoid suffering. 

Do you prefer to survive on your own, or will you seek allies to support you?
