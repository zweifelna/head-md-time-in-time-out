# An Oasis of Rythm

I continued to record interesting mixtures of sounds in Geneva. Three of them particularly interested me. So I had four people listen to my recordings and draw what they felt while listening. One drawing really inspired me: it depicts a scene with two people protecting themselves from the noisy elements with their music and attracting others to join them.

So it gave me the idea of a world of noisy and chaotic sounds where people survive thanks to some musicians creating their oasis of rhythm.

You can find all the drawings and records [here](../process/observations.md#2022-10-28/29).
