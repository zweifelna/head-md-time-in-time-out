Walking around Geneva, I found myself with a headache from the unpredictable noise of the surrounding construction. Fortunately, a steady beat from a country singer helped me to relieve the noise headache.

So I came up with the story of an old country musician who fights against the chaos of noise pollution with his regular and predictable rhythm. He would bring peace to the people who listen to his music.

You can find the record of the music [here](../process/observations.md#country-music).
